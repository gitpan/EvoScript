README - EvoScript v4.00 b1_01 - Wednesday July 1, 1998

Requirements:

  The following third-party libraries sre required for EvoScript to function. 
  Current versions should be available for downloadable from CPAN 
  (http://cpan.perl.org), but for convenience, copies of these libraries are
  also included in this distribution.

    Class::MethodMaker
    Ref
    Time::JulianDay
    Time::ParseDate
    URI::Heuristic

  Relational database support requires one or more of the following libraries
  which are not included in this distribution. Support for additional database 
  interfaces through the DBI system is anticipated in an upcomming release.

    Mysql
    Win32::ODBC

Manifest:

  EvoScript.cgi

    The core EvoScript executable, configured for use with CGI. 

  EvoScript_Included.cgi

    The EvoScript executable combined with all of the required Perl modules
    into a single, 13,000 line executable. If you're looking for a simple
    installation choice, this might be it -- all you need is Perl 5.003
    or later and a directory to hold your scripted page files.

  EvoScript_DB.cgi

    The EvoScript executable with additional modules that provide an OOP
    database interface. Supports tab-delimited text files and supports
    MySQL and Win32::ODBC, if these are installed/available in your Perl.

Release Notes:

  The documentation in this release is incomplete.
  For example, much of EvoScript's database wrapping functionality remains
  undocumented. This documentation is in the works and should be available
  sometime soon. So if you've downoladed this release, be sure to check the web
  site in a few weeks for the new documentation and sample record resources.

  The package names may be modified to better conform to CPAN convention after
  this release.
